# Bowlodrome Jiggs
Custom typeface inspired by my Father's engraved letter forms. Giglio "Jiggs" Pallotta was a machinist and metal spinner for the J. Schrader Company. When we were clearing out his workshop I found a bowling trophy plate that he'd engraved and I based this font on those letters. Software used is Inkscape to draw the glyphs and FontForge to develop the typeface.
